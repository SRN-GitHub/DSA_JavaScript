//*  STACK :

`The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements.
It operates on the principle of LIFO, where the last element added is the first to be removed.
Stack data structure has two main operations: push and pop.
Stack data structure is used in browser history tracking and the undo operation.

//*  QUEUE :
`Queue data structure follows FIFO principle. 
Analogy of a queue of people waiting in line
People enter at rear/tail & leave from front. 
Similar to stack data structure but with different behavior.
